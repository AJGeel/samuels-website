As a historian, I truly believe that history should be freely accessible. During my research about Black American soldiers during the Second World War, I came across various sources, which I had digitized and are now publicly available. The same goes for photographs, which I had digitized as part of my research, and which are now also available on my website. One of the things I've made available is the book *The Golden Cannon: A history of the 969th Field Artillery Battalion*. Feel free to check it out!
